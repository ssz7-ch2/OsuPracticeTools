# osu Practice Tools
Combination of some tools/programs ([osu-trainer](https://github.com/FunOrange/osu-trainer), [osu-practice-tool](https://github.com/JerryZhu99/osu-practice-tool), [OsuPracticeDiffMaker](https://github.com/ssz7-ch2/OsuPracticeDiffMaker))  
that I found useful into one program that's purely based on hotkeys.
